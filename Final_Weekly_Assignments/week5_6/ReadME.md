The files for the assignments of week 5 and 6 contain .py and .ipynb files.

While the notebooks contain the code and comments, it has not been run, as all the 
figures have been plotted in the .py files. It is therefore necessary to run these files
in order to ensure that the correct figures are found. 

Moreover, while copying the code from the .py to the notebooks, it is possible that
some of the code has been properly transferred. We apologize for the inconvenience and
hope that this will not be an issue.
